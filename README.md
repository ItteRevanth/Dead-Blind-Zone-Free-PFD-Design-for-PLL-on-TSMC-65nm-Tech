The PLLs serve as crucial components in generating stable, high-frequency signals essential for
various wireless communication functionalities. To meet the escalating demands of future wireless
networks, the focus lies on enhancing the performance of PLLs to ensure efficient and reliable
operation at millimetre-wave frequencies.
Two main issues of PFD are dead-zone and blind-zone which occur at zero and 180 degree phase shift repsectively. This design aims at improving those aspects of PFD and contributing to a better PLL designs given the modern-era communication systems needs.
